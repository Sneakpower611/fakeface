This API returns image URLs of fake human faces generated by <thispersondoesnotexist.com>.

Each image has been pre-analysed by an AI algorithm to identify gender and age (obviously non-exact).

As such, the user of the API can specify gender, minimum and maximum age for the image to be returned.

Data can be returned via JSON format, a direct redirect to the image or a simple response with the image URL.
